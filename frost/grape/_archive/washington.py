# Cold hardiness (Hc) ... the ability to tolerate freezing temperatures
# Hc is a dynamic trait that is acquired in response to shortening photoperiod
# and declining temperature in late fall or early winter.
#
# hardiness:init -> the Hc of endodormant buds in late summer or early fall
# after the shoots have formed brown periderm but before the subsequent,
# temperature-driven cold acclimation process in late fall and early winter.
#
# hc:min -> the least cold-hardy condition or minimum hardiness allowable
# set to the hardiness of green growing tissues (4th-leaf stage): -1.2째C
# for all V. vinifera cultivars and -2.5째C for V. labruscana cultivars

# theta -> exponent that varies by genotype. Permits the model to better
# capture the accelerated deacclimation observed just before budbreak.

# dormancy_boundary -> chilling degree days (DDc) required for dormancy
# release. Defines the transition of buds from endo- to ecodormancy.

# Transition from paradormancy to endodormancy is a prerequisite for the
# subsequent acquisition of full Hc. Temperature-driven acclimation /
# deacclimation cycles continue until the changes # leading up to budbreak
# render the deacclimation process irreversible. 

# measures low-temperature exotherms (LTE) and high-temperature exotherms
# (HTE). An LTE corresponds to the (lethal) temperature at which supercooled
# intracellular water freezes in # an organ. The Hc is expressed as LT50,
# which is the lethal temperature for 50% of buds tested. An HTE indicates
# the freezing of extracellular water, which occurs at higher temperatures
# and is usually not lethal, although it induces cellular dehydration.

# This dynamic thermal-time model predicts bud hardiness using genotype-specific coefficients
# (e.g., minimum and maximum hardiness, acclimation and deacclimation rates, ecodormancy boundary,
# etc.), with daily mean temperature as the single input variable.
# endo-dormancy : plant will not grow even under good, warm, growing conditions.
# eco-dormancy : plant is ready to grow but environmental conditions aren't right, usually too cold.

# Model has several limitations, including the low number of genotypes that were parameterized
# and relatively poor predictive performance during late winter/early spring, when buds are
# deacclimating. 

# Hc_min was taken as the hardiness of green growing tissues (4th-leaf stage):
